## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:

```bash
pip install tkinter matplotlib networkx
```

### Setup
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:
   - `ModuleSchedulerAppV2.py` (main application)
   - `modules.json` (module catalog)
   - `students.json` (student data)

3. Run the application:
```bash
python ModuleSchedulerAppV2.py
```

## Data Files

### modules.json
Contains the module catalog with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "code": "CS101",
    "name": "Introduction to Computer Science",
    "tracks": ["Computer Science", "Data Science"],
    "prerequisites": [],
    "credits": 3
  }
]
```

### students.json
Contains student information:
```json
[
  {
    "student_id": "123456",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "semester": 1,
    "completed": ["CS101", "MATH101"]
  }
]
```

## Algorithm Details

### Topological Sorting
The application uses **Kahn's Algorithm** for topological sorting to:
- Order modules based on prerequisite dependencies
- Ensure valid course sequences
- Detect impossible scheduling scenarios

### Cycle Detection
Uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to:
- Identify circular dependencies in prerequisites
- Prevent infinite loops in course planning
- Report problematic module chains

### Related Courses
Supports cross-disciplinary learning through predefined course relationships:
- Data Science ‚Üî Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics
- Biology ‚Üî Chemistry, Medicine, Microbiology
- And many more combinations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Module Class**: Represents individual academic modules
- **Student Class**: Manages student data and progress
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter-based interface with ttk styling
- **Graph Visualization**: matplotlib integration for dependency graphs
- **Data Management**: JSON-based configuration and student data

### Key Algorithms
- **Topological Sort**: Module ordering with cycle detection
- **Graph Theory**: NetworkX for dependency visualization
- **Credit Optimization**: Greedy algorithm for semester planning

## Customization

### Adding New Modules
Edit `modules.json` to add new modules:
```json
{
  "code": "NEW101",
  "name": "New Module Name",
  "tracks": ["Your Course"],
  "prerequisites": ["PREREQ101"],
  "credits": 3
}
```

### Adding Students
Edit `students.json` to add new students:
```json
{
  "student_id": "654321",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "course": "Mathematics",
  "year": 1,
  "semester": 2,
  "completed": []
}
```

### Course Relationships
Modify the `related_courses` dictionary in the code to add new course relationships.
